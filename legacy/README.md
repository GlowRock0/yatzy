## Game Description

In a single-player version of Yatzy, the player aims to achieve the highest possible score by rolling five dice and selecting combinations over 15 rounds. The player rolls the dice up to three times per turn, choosing which dice to keep and which to re-roll each time to achieve specific scoring combinations. After the final roll (or less depending on the strategy used), the player selects a category to score in, based on the dice outcomes, and records the score for that category. Each category can only be chosen once. The game continues until all 15 categories are filled, at which point the total score is calculated, and the player's performance is evaluated based on their final score.
